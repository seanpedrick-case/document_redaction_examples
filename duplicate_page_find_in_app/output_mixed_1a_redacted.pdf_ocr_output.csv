25,Managing Breathing Difficulties,480,113,692,46
25,WHY DO I FEEL BREATHLESS?,117,201,570,33
25,It is common for people who have had Covid-19 to feel breathless. Some of your breathing difficulties,117,264,1374,35
25,"may not have got better yet. You may be taking quicker, shorter and shallower breaths. You may",118,302,1313,34
25,notice that your shoulders are raised as you tense up and try and take in more air. Breathlessness can,117,339,1379,35
25,also be made worse by anxiety.,117,376,415,31
25,If you feel anxious and worried about being breathless this can make your muscles tense and cause your,117,436,1412,34
25,heart to beat faster. This can then make you breathe faster and make your breathlessness and anxiety,118,473,1387,33
25,worse. That is why it is important to stay in control of your breathing.,116,510,938,33
25,Some of the reasons why you still feel breathless are:,117,581,707,32
25,You may be producing too much mucus (fluid that coats and protects the inside of your airways).,171,633,1315,35
25,You may have a chesty cough.,171,688,404,31
25,You may be less fit than you used to be because you're not moving about and exercising as much.,171,740,1325,34
25,Covid-19 may have caused some damage to your lungs.,172,794,754,32
25,Your blood is pooling in the lower part of your body making you feel short of breath when you stand,171,847,1371,35

25,speak to your GP or call 111,1008,1050,463,32
25,Let's take a moment and have a think about what normal,118,1089,772,27
25,breathing should look like.,117,1126,352,32
25,"Normal breathing should be something you do without even thinking about it, it should be easy to do",118,1182,1379,35
25,and you should breathe in through your nose. When we breathe in this way the air is filtered to remove,117,1219,1399,35
25,any bacteria and dust. It's warmed up so it's the right temperature for your lungs and it becomes wet,117,1256,1364,34
25,in your nose. Normal breathing should be quiet. Your breath out should be slightly longer than your,118,1293,1358,34
25,breath in.,118,1332,131,25
25,"The diaphragm is the main muscle that controls your breathing. When we breathe in, the diaphragm",116,1382,1358,35
25,"pulls your ribcage down, sucking air into your lungs. When you breathe out, the diaphragm relaxes and",118,1419,1406,35
25,you let go of the air. Breathing out should require no effort whatsoever. When you don't breathe like,116,1456,1365,35
