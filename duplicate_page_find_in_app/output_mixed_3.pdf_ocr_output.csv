3,WHY DO I FEEL BREATHLESS?,117,201,570,33
3,It is common for people who have had Covid-19 to feel breathless. Some of your breathing difficulties,117,264,1374,35
3,"may not have got better yet. You may be taking quicker, shorter and shallower breaths. You may",118,302,1313,34
3,notice that your shoulders are raised as you tense up and try and take in more air. Breathlessness can,117,339,1379,35
3,also be made worse by anxiety.,117,376,415,31
3,If you feel anxious and worried about being breathless this can make your muscles tense and cause your,117,436,1412,34
3,heart to beat faster. This can then make you breathe faster and make your breathlessness and anxiety,118,473,1387,33
3,worse. That is why it is important to stay in control of your breathing.,116,510,938,33
3,Some of the reasons why you still feel breathless are:,117,581,707,32
3,You may be producing too much mucus (fluid that coats and protects the inside of your airways).,171,633,1315,35
3,You may have a chesty cough.,171,688,404,31
3,You may be less fit than you used to be because you're not moving about and exercising as much.,171,740,1325,34
3,Covid-19 may have caused some damage to your lungs.,172,794,754,32
3,Your blood is pooling in the lower part of your body making you feel short of breath when you stand,171,847,1371,35
3,up.,173,892,41,24
3,You have residual inflammation in your lungs and/or,170,938,710,32
3,If your breathlessness gets,1029,926,421,31
3,blood vessels.,173,975,185,25

3,You may be anxious.,171,1029,280,31
3,speak to your GP or call 111,1008,1050,463,32
3,Let's take a moment and have a think about what normal,118,1089,772,27
3,breathing should look like.,117,1126,352,32
3,"Normal breathing should be something you do without even thinking about it, it should be easy to do",118,1182,1379,35
3,and you should breathe in through your nose. When we breathe in this way the air is filtered to remove,117,1219,1399,35
3,any bacteria and dust. It's warmed up so it's the right temperature for your lungs and it becomes wet,117,1256,1364,34
3,in your nose. Normal breathing should be quiet. Your breath out should be slightly longer than your,118,1293,1358,34
3,breath in.,118,1332,131,25
3,"The diaphragm is the main muscle that controls your breathing. When we breathe in, the diaphragm",116,1382,1358,35
3,"pulls your ribcage down, sucking air into your lungs. When you breathe out, the diaphragm relaxes and",118,1419,1406,35
3,you let go of the air. Breathing out should require no effort whatsoever. When you don't breathe like,116,1456,1365,35

19,Dizziness,725,126,204,35
19,The word 'dizziness' means different things to different people; some use it to describe feeling,116,215,1272,32
19,"lightheaded or off balance, while others use it to describe a feeling that their surroundings are spinning.",117,253,1404,33
19,This can often make people to feel anxious or stressed. Stress can make you breathe quicker and more,116,314,1385,31
19,"shallow, which can make you feel dizzy. If you are affected in this way, your symptoms may feel worse",117,351,1385,32
19,and you may need some help to manage this.,117,388,629,32
19,For more information on stress and anxiety please see previous section of this workbook.,118,448,1195,32
19,It can be common after Covid-19 to have dizziness. This dizziness is often brought on by certain,173,527,1297,31
19,head positions or movements. Our balance system needs time to get used to movement again.,179,567,1281,33
19,Sometimes people get into the habit of avoiding positions and situations that may bring on,117,636,1326,32
19,their dizziness. This can really slow down their recovery and may cause other problems. If your,116,673,1378,32
19,"dizziness comes on with a specific movement such as turning your head side-ways, you might",117,711,1377,32
19,"start to avoid turning your head, and start using only your eyes to look at something instead.",117,748,1334,32
19,"To help with this, slowly start to make the movements that are causing your dizziness. Make sure",115,808,1398,32
19,you do this when you are somewhere that feels safe and comfortable for you. An example of this,117,846,1397,32
19,is described in the box below.,117,883,436,26
19,Dizziness exercise:,143,959,290,25
19,"Walk somewhere that you feel safe, like your hallway. Look slowly from side to side, turning your",141,1021,1314,32
19,"head as you walk. Then repeat looking up and down. Make sure it is also your head that moves, not",142,1064,1353,32
19,just your eyes.,139,1107,195,31
19,"To make this harder - try it in a busier but safe place, such as a supermarket aisle when holding",140,1182,1288,31
19,onto the trolley. Then build up to being able to do this outside.,141,1224,832,32
19,Please note these exercises are supposed to work your balance system in different ways. Some of,142,1300,1322,31
19,these exercises may make you feel slightly dizzy. Please do not worry if this happens as long as this,141,1342,1333,32
19,is manageable for you. This should get better the more/longer you practice.,141,1385,1008,32
