The deployment of early library catalogues for fundraising has been little studied. In this article, I shall try to explore how they came to serve this function in the early 18th century, focusing on the case of Harvard's 1723 catalogue. Many objects circulating in the early 18th-century world of print, and particularly in libraries, were intended to recognise or encourage philanthropy. Manuscript benefaction registers existed at many Oxford and Cambridge college libraries in the 17th and 18th centuries, inspired by the example set by Thomas Bodley, who began to prepare a 'publike Register' more than two years before the opening of the Bodleian Library on 8 November 1602 to record three kinds of gifts: 'one in bookes alone, an other in mony, and a third in bothe'. The sumptuous bindings and elaborate illustra- tions of surviving registers suggest that their chief purpose was to encourage gifts from prospective patrons. A particularly elaborate example from The Queen's College, Oxford, bound at the work- shop of the great Restoration bookbinder Samuel Mearne, was silver-embossed, with finely prepared calfskin used for its leaves. 4 (N[ew] London [CT] : Printed by T. Green, 1743). The only other American college li- brary catalogue printed before the American Revolution was Princeton's: A Catalogue of Books in the Library of the College of New-Jersey (Woodbridge [NJ] Printed by James Parker, 1760). All three have been reprinted in modern facsimile editions with intro- ductions: W. H.

The deployment of early library catalogues for fundraising has been little studied. In this article, I shall try to explore how they came to serve this function in the early 18th century, focusing on the case of Harvard's 1723 catalogue. Many objects circulating in the early 18th-century world of print, and particularly in libraries, were intended to recognise or encourage philanthropy. Manuscript benefaction registers existed at many Oxford and Cambridge college libraries in the 17th and 18th centuries, inspired by the example set by Thomas Bodley, who began to prepare a 'publike Register' more than two years before the opening of the Bodleian Library on 8 November 1602 to record three kinds of gifts: 'one in bookes alone, an other in mony, and a third in bothe'. The sumptuous bindings and elaborate illustra- tions of surviving registers suggest that their chief purpose was to encourage gifts from prospective patrons. A particularly elaborate example from The Queen's College, Oxford, bound at the work- shop of the great Restoration bookbinder Samuel Mearne, was silver-embossed, with finely prepared calfskin used for its leaves. 4 (N[ew] London [CT] : Printed by T. Green, 1743). The only other American college li- brary catalogue printed before the American Revolution was Princeton's: A Catalogue of Books in the Library of the College of New-Jersey (Woodbridge [NJ] Printed by James Parker, 1760).

It is common for people who have had Covid-19 to feel breathless. Some of your breathing difficulties may not have got better yet. You may be taking quicker, shorter and shallower breaths. You may notice that your shoulders are raised as you tense up and try and take in more air. Breathlessness can also be made worse by anxiety. If you feel anxious and worried about being breathless this can make your muscles tense and cause your heart to beat faster. This can then make you breathe faster and make your breathlessness and anxiety worse. That is why it is important to stay in control of your breathing. Some of the reasons why you still feel breathless are: You may be producing too much mucus (fluid that coats and protects the inside of your airways). You may have a chesty cough. You may be less fit than you used to be because you're not moving about and exercising as much. Covid-19 may have caused some damage to your lungs.

Normal breathing should be quiet. Your breath out should be slightly longer than your breath in. The diaphragm is the main muscle that controls your breathing. When we breathe in, the diaphragm pulls your ribcage down, sucking air into your lungs. When you breathe out, the diaphragm relaxes and you let go of the air.

Los Angeles Public Library holds one quire of eight leaves, with sewing thread still intact, one partial quire of six leaves, and twelve individual leaves, some of them consecutive, others isolated, from a 13th-century miscellany associated with the Priory. The fragments survive with a portion of their original binding, and the front and rear pastedowns. 3 It is difficult to say anything with certainty about the creation, housing and use of monastic books at Nostell, as SO little contextual evidence survives, either locally or nationally. Only ten book lists from Augustinian foundations in England are known, and with the exception of Llanthony Secunda Priory in Gloucester, where some 140 books are recorded, only ten Augustinian houses have more than ten volumes surviving from their libraries.4 The Priory of Merton, for example, was one of the largest in England and its Registrum lists more than 230 titles, yet today only twenty-nine volumes survive, while Leicester Abbey owned more than 1,000 volumes, of which fewer than twenty are known. 5 The Augustinian rule was not prescriptive in its approach to the conduct of religious life, leading to variation in approaches to the chapter of the rule concerned with reading and writing.

In 2012, Peter Kidd identified a further important frag- ment. Los Angeles Public Library holds one quire of eight leaves, with sewing thread still intact, one partial quire of six leaves, and twelve individual leaves, some of them consecutive, others isolated, from a 13th-century miscellany associated with the Priory. The fragments survive with a portion of their original binding, and the front and rear pastedowns. 3 It is difficult to say anything with certainty about the creation, housing and use of monastic books at Nostell, as SO little contextual evidence survives, either locally or nationally. Only ten book lists from Augustinian foundations in England are known, and with the exception of Llanthony Secunda Priory in Gloucester, where some 140 books are recorded, only ten Augustinian houses have more than ten volumes surviving from their libraries.4 The Priory of Merton, for example, was one of the largest in England and its Registrum lists more than 230 titles, yet today only twenty-nine volumes survive, while Leicester Abbey owned more than 1,000 volumes, of which fewer than twenty are known. 5 The Augustinian rule was not prescriptive in its approach to the conduct of religious life, leading to variation in approaches to the chapter of the rule concerned with reading and writing.
