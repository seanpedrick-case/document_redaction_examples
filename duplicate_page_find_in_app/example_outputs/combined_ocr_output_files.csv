Winn was keen to make it his own: it is inscribed '[Ge]orge Wynn owneth this booke', the ownership also witnessed by one George Stinton. George Winn's son, the 2nd Baronet, was equally keen to assert ownership on inheriting the same book, signing it 'Edmund Winn: Liber hic meus testis est.' By I October 1695 the book had changed hands again, signed by Edmund's brother, George Winn (b.c.1645), then later still it was signed by Rowland Winn, 3rd Baronet. The 1695 date of George Winn's inscription is pertinent, coming the year after the death of his father, and other inscriptions indicate that this transfer may have been part of a wider dispersal of books. A group of nine books were all marked in 1696 by Edmund Winn of Acton (1678-1743), the second son of the 2nd Baronet, perhaps an inheritance from his father, although none bear his mark. Alongside these few books marked by various early members of the Winn family are several hundred other contemporary books of a similar type, bound in unremarkable English bindings and acquired in the 17th century, many on the second-hand market and with earlier Yorkshire owners. We have no reason not to assume that these share a common provenance. Building a Library: The Acquisition of the Ludlam Family Books This accretion of family books represents the first stirrings of a dynastic family library at Nostell. The growing belief that a landed family should have a library and that it represented their wealth, status and pedigree is apparent from the numerous early armorial bookplates commissioned in the period 1690-1710. These reflect a series of contemporary changes in taste and fashion in book collect- ing, library use and library design. With a few notable exceptions, mostearly 17th-century private libraries were 'closet' libraries, small collections of practical books kept in a locked chest or in a closet off a bedchamber, and as such wholly private spaces for study, devotion and contemplation. With the increase in printed output in the 16th and 17th centuries, books became more affordable and more widely accessible. Libraries began to outgrow the closet. The Winn family in the 17th century were certainly not bib- liophiles, but the changing cultural trends in book ownership 55"

When he died in 1826, Nichols bequeathed his 'private topographical library and Prints' to his son and divided his other books, prints and pictures between him and his sisters. 52 There is no inventory of titles in his will, SO it sheds little light on his library.

output_mixed_1a_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,6,"FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF BENEFACTIONS The concept extended beyond universities and across the Atlantic: when John Sharp, Archbishop of York, proposed that the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) should help establish a library in New York in 1713, he saw fit to stipulate 'that a Book of Benefactions and Subscriptions shall lye on the Table where it may be lawfull for others to subscribe books or money'.5 Sharp also appreciated the importance of catalogues as mobile representations of the library, portable artefacts that could signify material realities an ocean away. He specified that a 'Catalogue of this Library signed by the Governour the Mayor of the City for the time being and one of the Clergy shall be lodged with the Keeper of His Grace the Archbishop of Canterburys Library at St Martins as also Catalogues of all the parochial Librarys'.6 Likewise, in 17I5, members of the SPG sought donations of books to augment the library of Codrington College in Barbados. Dudley Woodbridge, judge-advocate of Barbados and an active member of the SPG, so- licited gifts of books while in England; he returned to Barbados with 'a Catalogue of Books, contributed in England to the same Purpose, which he was ordered to carry over with him'. The members ap- preciated the value that circulating the list would have in soliciting further donations, as St. George Ashe's sermon reported that 'this Catalogue has been proposed to be printed, for the Encouragement of Benefactions, and Advancement of the said Library'. By the early 1720s, library catalogues circulated in England with this more explicit purpose. Notable among them was the catalogue of Sion College Library, prepared by William Reading, according to its 1721 printed subscription proposal, 'that the Learned may be fully inform'd at their own Studies what the Library affords upon any Subject, and that such as are disposed to be Benefactors to it, 5.

Long Covid has probably affected your body and your ability to do things the way you used to. This can make you feel like your illness controls your life. However, although you might struggle to control the effect of Long Covid on your body, you still have control over how you want to live your life. It might take some adjustments but it is in your control. For example, you might not be able to stop from feeling tired when going out. However, you can continue to go out by making sure you take regular breaks or do activities that do not need any physical activity. Try to do things that make you happy: People like different activities. It depends on their fitness levels and what they are interested in. Think of the things you enjoy doing and put them in your diary. Put off your worry: It may feel that worry controls your life, and that you can't stop yourself from worrying. We will often try to push our thoughts away, but this usually does not work, as our worries seem to always return. Try to put off your worry rather than pushing it away. This can help you feel more in control over your worry, instead of your worry being in control of you. Please look at page 44 to learn how to put off worry. Problem-solving: It is possible that a lot of stressful things have happened to you because of Covid-19. For example: dealing with your work, house, money, illness. Such things may have made you worry about the future. Learning good problem-solving skills can help you find solutions to your problems, lessen worry, and get some control back over your life. Please look at page 45 to learn skills on problem solving. Try not to hold back thoughts and feelings: You may feel snowed under with your emotions. Some of us may try to avoid our thoughts and feelings because we are afraid we will not be able to managethem. But if we do that, we worry more. Remember, that we all have emotions, and we have the right to feel them, whether other people believe it's right or not.

output_mixed_1a_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,14,"THE BOOK COLLECTOR However, library catalogues in this period served just as much to advance the fundraising needs of their relatively fledgling institu- tions as they did to connect books and readers, especially critical since these institutions did not generally have funds available for the purchase of books and were completely reliant on donations. The deployment of early library catalogues for fundraising has been little studied. In this article, I shall try to explore how they came to serve this function in the early 18th century, focusing on the case of Harvard's 1723 catalogue. Many objects circulating in the early 18th-century world of print, and particularly in libraries, were intended to recognise or encourage philanthropy. Manuscript benefaction registers existed at many Oxford and Cambridge college libraries in the 17th and 18th centuries, inspired by the example set by Thomas Bodley, who began to prepare a 'publike Register' more than two years before the opening of the Bodleian Library on 8 November 1602 to record three kinds of gifts: 'one in bookes alone, an other in mony, and a third in bothe'. The sumptuous bindings and elaborate illustra- tions of surviving registers suggest that their chief purpose was to encourage gifts from prospective patrons. A particularly elaborate example from The Queen's College, Oxford, bound at the work- shop of the great Restoration bookbinder Samuel Mearne, was silver-embossed, with finely prepared calfskin used for its leaves. 4 (N[ew] London [CT] : Printed by T. Green, 1743).

If you can find triggers, and either cut them out completely, or reduce them to a manageable level, this should help to improve your symptoms and energy levels. Build in rest periods The level of activity/rest that you can manage without making your symptoms worse is known as your baseline activity. Finding this will take time, but it will let you gradually manage to do a little bit more of the activities you managed to do before you had Covid-19. Please also see the sections on pacing. Self-monitoring activity The Workwell Foundation advises that if you have PESE, you should have a maximum heart rate of 15 beats per minute above your normal resting heart rate, when you are doing any activity. This means that if your heart rate climbs to 15 beats higher than your resting heart rate, you should stop the activity to prevent PESE. A heart rate monitor may help you to keep an eye on this at home. This is because above this rate your body naturally starts to use the method of creating energy without oxygen. This means that your energy will run out faster.

WILLIAM PATRICK 'RICK' WATSON has sent news of his impending retirement after more than fifty years in the book trade (in part with Quaritch, but mostly by himself). A distinguished dealer in rare scientific books, his learned and elegant catalogues were always 'keepers' and have become essential reference tools in their own right. His remaining books have been consigned to Christie's. The so-called SPETCHLEY BINDINGS - a magnificent pair of English embroidered bindings of crimson velvet, gold and sequins - have been added to the National Art Library, allocated to the V&A as part of the Acceptance in Lieu Scheme. Curator Catherine Yvard, writing for the V&A blog, explained: 'This set of two volumes, consisting of a Holy Bible (dated 1632, though actually 1633) and a Book of Common Prayer (1634) was probably commissioned for the Chapel Royal at Whitehall, which was for the use of the King and his family; they are said to have been gift- ed by Charles I to Sir Robert Berkeley of Spetchley (1584-1656). They remained with the Berkeley family of Spetchley Park (Worcestershire) until 2022.' With fabulous embroidery including the royal arms and ci- pher, they are from the workshop of Edmund Harrison (1590-1667), the King's Embroiderer whose career spanned the reigns of James I, Charles I and Charles II. The Spetchley Book of Common Prayer is now on display at the V&A's British Galleries (gallery 56 and online). Similar embroidered bindings were given to royal courtiers and a slightly earlier example, also a Book of Common Prayer bound in Harrison's embroidery, is preserved at the National Trust's Ham House in Surrey. According to a dealer, Howard Mather, the well-known bibliophile Anthony Hobson used to get his butler to paste his distinctive bookplate on his books and pamphlets, 'which makes it funnier when an occasional one is found upside-down on the rear endpaper'. No doubt members of THE BOOKPLATE SOCIETY, which celebrated its 50th anniversary on 30 September 2022, will know of many other such anecdotes, concerning the small, personalised marvels of design and print. Perhaps such anecdotes will find their way into one of their future publications, all of which are richly researched, attractive and affordable. 143"

H. married Gertrude Adelaide Vaughan (1890- 1938) and their only son, Anthony, was born at Rhyl in the follow- ing year. They lived at I, Bedford Square until the British Museum commandeered part of the back garden to build the new Duveen gallery, when the family moved to Chelsea Park Gardens. Anthony was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford, graduating in modern languages. He served in the Scots Guards from 1941-46, having taken part in the Italian Campaign, then ending up in Intelligence. He never lost his upright military bearing. Before em- barking on his career as auctioneer and scholar, he travelled in Italy, Greece, Turkey, Spain and Portugal, adding Italian and Spanish to his already fluent French and good German. When G. D. H. died in 1949, Anthony, who had joined the auction house in 1947, became head of the Book Department and a Director of Sotheby's. He held these functions until 1971. His scholarship during these years is evident from the well-researched catalogues, many written by himself. He masterminded a number of important sales, such as those of the Dyson-Perrins Collection of medieval manuscripts (1958-60), the books and bindings belonging to Major J. R. Abbey (1965-78), and perhaps the most famous of all, the residue of the enormous collection of books and manuscripts of Sir Thomas Phillipps, lasting from 1965 to 1977. He recruited a team of experts, among whom were Andreas Mayor and Christopher de Hamel, who, in a charming personal recollection of his former boss, emphasised Anthony's erudition, astonishingly retentive memory and 'relentless industry""2. Disenchanted with changes in the compa- ny, he resigned in 1977. In 1959 he had married Tanya Vinogradov (1929-1988), daughter of the historian Igor Vinogradov. They had a son and two daugh- ters and Tanya accompanied Anthony on his extensive travels to libraries and collections of rare books and bindings, taking many of the photographs that came to illustrate her husband's lectures and publications. 2.

output_mixed_1a_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,25,"Managing Breathing Difficulties WHY DO I FEEL BREATHLESS? It is common for people who have had Covid-19 to feel breathless. Some of your breathing difficulties may not have got better yet. You may be taking quicker, shorter and shallower breaths. You may notice that your shoulders are raised as you tense up and try and take in more air. Breathlessness can also be made worse by anxiety. If you feel anxious and worried about being breathless this can make your muscles tense and cause your heart to beat faster. This can then make you breathe faster and make your breathlessness and anxiety worse. That is why it is important to stay in control of your breathing. Some of the reasons why you still feel breathless are: You may be producing too much mucus (fluid that coats and protects the inside of your airways). You may have a chesty cough. You may be less fit than you used to be because you're not moving about and exercising as much. Covid-19 may have caused some damage to your lungs. Your blood is pooling in the lower part of your body making you feel short of breath when you stand up. You have residual inflammation in your lungs and/or If your breathlessness gets blood vessels. worse suddenly, for no apparent reason, you should You may be anxious. speak to your GP or call 111 Let's take a moment and have a think about what normal breathing should look like. Normal breathing should be something you do without even thinking about it, it should be easy to do and you should breathe in through your nose. When we breathe in this way the air is filtered to remove any bacteria and dust. It's warmed up so it's the right temperature for your lungs and it becomes wet in your nose. Normal breathing should be quiet. Your breath out should be slightly longer than your breath in. The diaphragm is the main muscle that controls your breathing. When we breathe in, the diaphragm pulls your ribcage down, sucking air into your lungs. When you breathe out, the diaphragm relaxes and you let go of the air. Breathing out should require no effort whatsoever. When you don't breathe like this you use up more energy and can get tired easily.

This helped both my physical and mental health. Now I can't do this I feel very down, as it is just too tiring for me.' Try to think about or write down what values are behind why Anne loves walking with her friend: Examples of what values could be part of this activity are: connection, adventure, communication, friendship. Now with a values approach let's see what Anne does now: 'It was not until I thought about it, being out in the open air somewhere new and having that connection with my friend was what mattered to me. We now meet somewhere for a picnic, snack or coffee; we've gone to so many new spots and still enjoy the time together like before.' Another helpful way to start identifying your values is by reflecting on times when you felt really good about yourself and really confident that you were making good choices. You could ask yourself the following questions: 1. When was I the happiest? What was I doing during this time? Who was I with? Where was I? 2. When was a time that I felt proud? Why was I proud? Did anyone else share my pride? What other factors contributed to me feeling proud? 3. When was a time that you felt most fulfilled and satisfied? What need or desire was fulfilled? How and why did the experience give your life meaning? What other factors contributed to your feelings of fulfilment? 4. Why is each experience important and memorable?

output_mixed_2_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,8,"Work And Education What is work? Work can be paid employment (either self-employed or employed by a company), or something you do on a voluntary basis. Voluntary work can include looking after children or a loved one regularly or working for a local charity. You might be retired, but still take part in community activities, or you might be a student going to school, college or university. Employment, work or education can be meaningful and important in different ways. Work can be a way of making money, but it can also be something that gives you enjoyment, pride, and it can make you feel good about yourself. Not being in work, or not being able to manage at work for whatever reason, can be scary. This section will focus on getting you back to paid work, but it should also be useful if you go to school, college or university, or if you volunteer. What to do while you are off work: While you are off work there are a few things you need to do: Keep in touch with your employer and/or line manager. Find out about your workplace sickness absence policy. Know what your rights and responsibilities are about staying in contact with your line manager. Speak to your employer about what sickness benefits you may be able to get. Ask your employer if you will still be getting paid in full, or just getting Statutory Sick Pay (SSP). Speak to your line manager about being referred to occupational health (if your workplace has one). If you are getting Statutory Sick Pay, it is useful to ask your employer and/or line manager how long this will last for. For more information about other benefits or to get advice about income maximisation, please visit the following website: https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits What to do when you feel ready to go back to work: If you are off for 7 or less days you can self-certify for this period (you might need to fill in a form). If you have been off for more than 7 days, you will need to get a fit note from your healthcare professional, usually your GP. For more information, please visit: https://www.gov.uk/taking-sick-leave Speak to your employer and/or line manager before you go back to work to plan your return. Make a plan (if possible) of what you will be expected to do when you return to work. Remember all your coping strategies in your tool box and use then when you need them. 66 Long Covid Workbook"

output_mixed_2_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,10,"Pace It is important to balance activity with rest. You may need to rest during activity and allow yourself some extra time to finish what you are doing. Pacing will help you have enough energy to manage your daily activities. It will help you recover faster if you work on a task until your battery is half full rather than empty. Slow and steady wins the race! Finding a healthy balance can be quite difficult, as on some days you will have more energy than others. Make sure to rest on both 'good' and 'bad' days, and rest before you feel fatigued. Top tips for pacing yourself during the day: Break up activities into smaller tasks Use the phone or internet rather than going out Spread tasks throughout the day Build in regular rest periods Plan to rest and recharge between activities Set an alarm (on your phone) to remind you to stop and rest Sit and rest when you can Position Having good postures and comfortable body positions when carrying out tasks (including resting) is really important to help you save energy. For example, sitting in a supportive armchair when watching TV or leaning your hips against the kitchen worktop when washing the dishes. Good posture lowers the amount of energy needed, as muscles don't need to work as hard. If possible avoid stretching, over-reaching and bending down. Think about how you sit and stand during the day - can you change your posture or position to stop you getting uncomfortable? Top tips to improve your posture during the day: Get closer to a task to avoid over-stretching Use both hands when lifting and carrying Keep frequently used items close together (tea and coffee near the kettle) Slide items along work surfaces Sit down to do tasks if you can (peeling potatoes over a bowl on the table, or sitting on the toilet when brushing your teeth) Use gravity to help you - allow something to fall rather than place it on the floor Permission Allow yourself NOT to do tasks that make you breathless and fatigued. It is OK to say NO, and also OK to ask for help from family or a friend when you are finding things tough. Show them your activity diary so they get an idea of what you can manage. Tell them what you need help with. Instead of thinking 'I must' or 'I should', try to change your thinking to 'I choose to', 'I would like to' or 'I wish to'. Don't force yourself to do too much and stop and rest if you are getting too puffed out or tired. 10 Long Covid Workbook"

In February 1780 he asked to borrow the last edition of Hughes's Letters; and hoped Nichols would get 'Dennis upon Blackmore, and upon Cato, and anything of the same writer against Pope'. 36 In May he asked for the Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany Poems edited by Elijah Fenton and Sir Richard Blackmore's Essays upon Several Subjects37 and later the same year, impressed by Nichols's ability to track down rare books, Johnson asked him to find an edition of Prior's works published in 1740. 38 Other borrowers included Joseph Banks, who borrowed The Craftsman in 179539 and Joseph Warton, who bor- rowed William Bowyer's copy of the works of Alexander Pope in ten volumes in 1797. 40 But some books were not for loan: in 1805, when Samuel Pipe Wolferstan, a key helper in Nichols's History of Leicestershire, asked to borrow Thomas Hearne's 1774 edition of the Black Book of the Exchequer, he was told that it was interleaved with notes and too valuable to lend, but that he was welcome to consult it when next in London.41 Nichols was wise to be wary because not everything was safely re- turned. In 1797 John Baker Holroyd, Ist Earl of Sheffield, returned William Lambarde's Perambulation of Kent and Thomas Philpot's Villari Cantianum which Nichols had lent to Edward Gibbon in 1793 but which were found at Sheffield Park after Gibbon's death in 1794.

We pull it closer - We keep thinking about what makes us worry, hoping to solve it. Instead, because our worry has not happened yet, or may never happen, we get stuck in having negative thoughts about the future that we cannot control or solve. 2. We push it away. We try to get rid of the worry by telling ourselves to stop thinking about it! It seems that the more we try to push it away and not think about it the stronger the worry comes back. What if I told you to not think of a pink elephant? The first thing you probably did was start imagining a pink elephant! It's the same if we try not to think about the thing that is worrying us. No matter which of these two things you do it is very likely that both will stop you from thinking about your day-to-day activities and the things you like doing.

Don't do it too close to bedtime as it might stop you from sleeping. Put-off During the day, if you notice a worry popping into your head, instead of pushing it away or pulling it closer, you can let the thought come into your head. Then tell yourself you will put off thinking about it for now and give your attention to it during worry time. You can say to yourself something like 'I just had a worry thought of This is okay. I will let it go for now and I will come back to it during my worry time'. Once you decide to put off your worry, bring your attention back to the present moment and the thing you were doing. If another thought or the same thought pops into your head, put it off again. You can also write your worry in a notepad for you to remember later. During worry time Think about the worries you had during the day and focus on the ones that are still important. If they are no longer important, you can cross them off your list.

output_mixed_2_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,22,"THE BOOK COLLECTOR However, library catalogues in this period served just as much to advance the fundraising needs of their relatively fledgling institu- tions as they did to connect books and readers, especially critical since these institutions did not generally have funds available for the purchase of books and were completely reliant on donations. The deployment of early library catalogues for fundraising has been little studied. In this article, I shall try to explore how they came to serve this function in the early 18th century, focusing on the case of Harvard's 1723 catalogue. Many objects circulating in the early 18th-century world of print, and particularly in libraries, were intended to recognise or encourage philanthropy. Manuscript benefaction registers existed at many Oxford and Cambridge college libraries in the 17th and 18th centuries, inspired by the example set by Thomas Bodley, who began to prepare a 'publike Register' more than two years before the opening of the Bodleian Library on 8 November 1602 to record three kinds of gifts: 'one in bookes alone, an other in mony, and a third in bothe'. The sumptuous bindings and elaborate illustra- tions of surviving registers suggest that their chief purpose was to encourage gifts from prospective patrons. A particularly elaborate example from The Queen's College, Oxford, bound at the work- shop of the great Restoration bookbinder Samuel Mearne, was silver-embossed, with finely prepared calfskin used for its leaves. 4 (N[ew] London [CT] : Printed by T.

His services were engaged again to print the catalogue, which must have been a more complicated and multilingual project than he was accustomed to. Hugh Amory has discussed the irregular sizing of Greek versus Roman and italic type and the wide variety of initial capitals in the catalogue, as well as its unusual format (quarto in 2s), all of which suggest a printer out of his depth. 19 The Harvard catalogue may not have been a typographic master- piece, but by the Harvard Corporation's 5 October 1723 meeting, it had finally been printed and stitched. The Corporation voted to send IOO of the catalogues to England, ordering 'that 30 of them be deliver'd to Mr Hollis, 30 to Mr Neal, I2 to Mr Newman, I2 to Mr Agent Dummer, 6 to Governor Shute, 6. to Iohn Chamberlayne Esq & 4 to Mr Loyd'.

output_mixed_2_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,27,"THE BOOK COLLECTOR building of the new house. 13 Assessing Winn book ownership of any period is complicated by the preponderance of Edmunds, Georges and Rowlands, and by the family's inconsistency in signing their books. The earliest book with a definitive Winn family inscription is a bind-up of an edition of Horace printed in Paris in I 544 with an edition of Juvenal printed in Lyon in I557, which bears a rare dated inscription: Ed: Win 1602 (fig. 4), identifying it as a book from the library of Edmund Winn of Thornton Curtis (1583-c.1645), the son of Elizabeth I's draper. 14 This book must have come to Nostell with the family, along with three other books bearing inscriptions also relating to this Edmund Winn, all printed in the early 17th century. 15 13. Three significant collections of early books at Nostell can be discounted, as they were acquired post-1750. Firstly, in 1781, Louise Sabine d'Hervart (1734-1798), the wife of the 5th Baronet, inherited from her mother a collection of 'Bound and un- bound books, French, German and English'. These books were shipped from her fam- ily home in Vevey, Switzerland, and remain at Nostell today. The French and German books are relatively easy to identify - many are bound in characteristic Swiss bindings, or marked with the names of former d'Hervart, Weiss, and Dünz owners- the English books less so, but around I50 books can now be securely identified from the inheri- tance. Secondly, Charles Winn acquired significant numbers of early-printed books in the 19th century, but he was assiduous in recording his ownership: his books are all clearly marked with inscriptions, stencils and bookplates. He was equally assiduous in not marking books inherited by him. Thirdly, the West Yorkshire Archive Service contains a collection of 254 Civil War pamphlets, accessioned as part of the Nostell Priory papers. The examination of these volumes, however, suggests that these were not collected by the family during the Civil War, but instead by Charles Winn in the 19th century. WYL1352/A1/8/34/1-245 are bound in paper bearing the watermark of (among others) Gilling & Allford, active in the first quarter of the 19th century. Many bear an 18th or 19th-century ink monogram stamp, YMJ, indicating they were not at Nostell in the 17th century, while WYL1352/A1/8/59/1-12 are bound in waste wrap- pers from subscription books issued in the 1780s and 1790s, indicating that they were in the book trade at that time. Once these three sources are discounted, around 1,000 titles remain printed prior to 1750, none of which bear contrary evidence of ownership. It is the contention of this paper that these represent the Winn family library amassed before the move to the new house. 14. Horace, Q.

output_mixed_3_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,3,"Managing Breathing Difficulties WHY DO I FEEL BREATHLESS? It is common for people who have had Covid-19 to feel breathless. Some of your breathing difficulties may not have got better yet. You may be taking quicker, shorter and shallower breaths. You may notice that your shoulders are raised as you tense up and try and take in more air. Breathlessness can also be made worse by anxiety. If you feel anxious and worried about being breathless this can make your muscles tense and cause your heart to beat faster. This can then make you breathe faster and make your breathlessness and anxiety worse. That is why it is important to stay in control of your breathing. Some of the reasons why you still feel breathless are: You may be producing too much mucus (fluid that coats and protects the inside of your airways). You may have a chesty cough. You may be less fit than you used to be because you're not moving about and exercising as much. Covid-19 may have caused some damage to your lungs. Your blood is pooling in the lower part of your body making you feel short of breath when you stand up. You have residual inflammation in your lungs and/or If your breathlessness gets blood vessels. worse suddenly, for no apparent reason, you should You may be anxious. speak to your GP or call 111 Let's take a moment and have a think about what normal breathing should look like. Normal breathing should be something you do without even thinking about it, it should be easy to do and you should breathe in through your nose. When we breathe in this way the air is filtered to remove any bacteria and dust. It's warmed up so it's the right temperature for your lungs and it becomes wet in your nose. Normal breathing should be quiet. Your breath out should be slightly longer than your breath in. The diaphragm is the main muscle that controls your breathing. When we breathe in, the diaphragm pulls your ribcage down, sucking air into your lungs. When you breathe out, the diaphragm relaxes and you let go of the air. Breathing out should require no effort whatsoever. When you don't breathe like this you use up more energy and can get tired easily.

Ex Libris ran for eighteen years with a well-illustrated journal, something its descendant follows today. Out of it sprang The Bookplate Exchange Club, which survived for eighty years until 1972 when the late Brian North Lee, the doyen of bookplate studies, and its last secretary, Peter Summers FSA, founded The Bookplate Society. Fifty years on the Society actively pro- motes, explores and explains these miniature signs of ownership, focusing as much on designers as on owners. The humble bookplate, often not even mentioned in book auctions and catalogues, is now becoming noted and any collector interested in their books' personal history, will find much of interest in The Bookplate Society publications, as it delves into allied interests of heraldry, printing, engraving and graphic arts. The bookplate is often a work of art, SO it is not surprising that when the British Museum/ Library split, the Bookplate collection donated by Franks and others should reside with prints and drawings. A similar anniversariant is THE OXFORD GUILD OF PRINTERS, which last year celebrated its fortieth birthday. Since 2013 it has circulated to its entire membership (which now stands at 140) an autumnal package, eagerly awaited, of letterpress ephemera produced by its members during the year. In this delightful bouquet may be found in every font under the sun a running commentary on politics, social affairs, the health of the book trade and the prowess (as it has latterly been) of the England cricket team.

The contents are extraor- dinarily congenial and much as you'd expect from the title. It has three faults. One is the absence of an index, with consequences that need no ex- planation.

The fragments survive with a portion of their original binding, and the front and rear pastedowns. 3 It is difficult to say anything with certainty about the creation, housing and use of monastic books at Nostell, as SO little contextual evidence survives, either locally or nationally. Only ten book lists from Augustinian foundations in England are known, and with the exception of Llanthony Secunda Priory in Gloucester, where some 140 books are recorded, only ten Augustinian houses have more than ten volumes surviving from their libraries.4 The Priory of Merton, for example, was one of the largest in England and its Registrum lists more than 230 titles, yet today only twenty-nine volumes survive, while Leicester Abbey owned more than 1,000 volumes, of which fewer than twenty are known. 5 The Augustinian rule was not prescriptive in its approach to the conduct of religious life, leading to variation in approaches to the chapter of the rule concerned with reading and writing.

Unlike the Harvard Catalogus of 1723, which Thomas Hollis criticised for being ordered only by initial letter, Yale's catalogue was fully alphabetised and also categorised 'under proper Heads' - that is, by subject as well as by author. Whether or not the Yale catalogue was actively used to solicit donations is unclear - considering the abundance of positive evidence for other printed pieces, perhaps it was not - but it was certainly designed more for users than for donors, representing an important departure from the approach of the Harvard Catalogus. Thomas Clap's preface is not grandiloquent and aimed at those unfamiliar with the college; it is remarkably brief - hardly two pages long - and addressed 'To the Students of Yale-College.4 Yale's catalogue is physically unimpressive and highly functional. It reflects a transitional moment for libraries, for philanthropy and indeed for the American colonies. By 1743, Yale's library might not have been ideally stocked, but it served a college more amply resourced than it had ever been and a colony with better access to local learning than it had ever had. Yale no longer needed to make obsequious cries of poverty abroad: with the publication of the 1743 catalogue, the college ceased to advertise its weaknesses and began to assert its strengths. Portable, relatively inexpensive, produced in quantity, the library catalogue as a form of printed matter uniquely enabled transatlantic philanthropy in the early 18th century. College leaders and their agents abroad worked together to build a strategic network of influential supporters for the cause of colonial education. The first Harvard library catalogue in particular was created as a tool for salesmanship, meant in the short term to increase the library's hold- ings and only in the longer term to advance the learning that might result. The underlying irony of flibrary-building in this period is that by underscoring the poverty of colonial education, catalogues and the agents who deployed them succeeded in vastly enriching it. 42.

The secondary theatres were: Théâtre du Vaudeville, reserved for short plays in couplets or with popular tunes Théâtre des Variétés, for short, ribald rustic plays of low-life and the peasantry Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, for melodrama, light operas, ballets and spectacles Théâtre de la Gaîté, for pantomimes of all sorts (but not ballet), harlequinades and farces. A third category was also authorised, the Petits théâtres, also called Forains, for performing animals, acrobats, puppet shows and the like, which in Paris came to include the Théâtre des Funambules, the Petit Lazari, the Théâtre Acrobate de Madame Saqui, the Cirque Olympique and the peripatetic tents and booths set up in the capital and throughout the countryside. Censorship became a large part of the government's regulation of the theatre and was used to suppress any ideas that might encourage anti-government or dissident views, especially in the theatres that catered to the working class, whose activities were frequently under surveillance by the police. A Gagliani guide to Paris mentions the 'degeneracy' of the 'public taste'. In fact, the theatre was among the most highly censored artforms of the time, (caricature was similarly controlled), with theatre censorship lasting until 1906. 11 Even the co- lour of the paper for posters was regulated (white paper was reserved for the government while specific colours were assigned to the various theatres). Additionally, all posters were required to be uni- form in size, and a new law enacted in 1852 mandated that all theatre posters had to be submitted to the Commission d'examen des ouvrages dramatiques before being sent to the police for final authorisation. 12 10. Galignani's New Paris Guide (1839), p. 455. 11. e.g., Odile Krakovitch (curator at the Archives Nationales de France) discovered that in 1852, French censors examined 682 plays, of which 59 were forbidden, 323 un- derwent modifications and 54 were awaiting consideration, leaving only 246 (36%) authorised plays.

output_mixed_3_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,19,"Dizziness The word 'dizziness' means different things to different people; some use it to describe feeling lightheaded or off balance, while others use it to describe a feeling that their surroundings are spinning. This can often make people to feel anxious or stressed. Stress can make you breathe quicker and more shallow, which can make you feel dizzy. If you are affected in this way, your symptoms may feel worse and you may need some help to manage this. For more information on stress and anxiety please see previous section of this workbook. It can be common after Covid-19 to have dizziness. This dizziness is often brought on by certain head positions or movements. Our balance system needs time to get used to movement again. Sometimes people get into the habit of avoiding positions and situations that may bring on their dizziness. This can really slow down their recovery and may cause other problems. If your dizziness comes on with a specific movement such as turning your head side-ways, you might start to avoid turning your head, and start using only your eyes to look at something instead. To help with this, slowly start to make the movements that are causing your dizziness. Make sure you do this when you are somewhere that feels safe and comfortable for you. An example of this is described in the box below. Dizziness exercise: Walk somewhere that you feel safe, like your hallway. Look slowly from side to side, turning your head as you walk. Then repeat looking up and down. Make sure it is also your head that moves, not just your eyes. To make this harder - try it in a busier but safe place, such as a supermarket aisle when holding onto the trolley. Then build up to being able to do this outside. Please note these exercises are supposed to work your balance system in different ways. Some of these exercises may make you feel slightly dizzy. Please do not worry if this happens as long as this is manageable for you. This should get better the more/longer you practice. It is important to speak to a healthcare professional about your dizziness, as it could also be caused by other things such as: Ear condition Dehydration Some types of medication Low blood sugar levels Anxiety or stress Postural hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing) Iron deficiency (lack of iron) POTS (see previous section of this workbook, page 55) If you have any hearing loss, constant tinnitus (ringing or other noises in one or both ears), worsening of your symptoms, or a new unusual pattern to them, contact your GP. 58 Long Covid Workbook"

After speaking about a runner bringing in to Rota a copy of The Road to Oxiana in dust wrapper, for which he was asking £25, K writes about Setitia Butler, who is living proof of the old adage that 'style is character'. Ms Butler, who was later to be the wife of another bookseller, Anthony Simmonds, was distinguished on a few fronts: she was a serious friend of the author, the niece of Robert Byron and one of the last people to see Lord Lucan. The afternoon of the day he murdered his nanny with a sec- tion of lead piping, having mistaken her in the dark for his wife, he came to see Setitia, who was then working at Heywood Hill, to settle his ac- count. (This in itself is extraordinary though K passes over it.) Many years later, while working at Peter Ellis, K falls into conversation with an ex- policeman who had been the first to arrive at the Lucans' house. Here I quote the author: 'I would like to have asked him whether Lady Lucan was still flushed from having made love with Lord Lucan after the mur- der.' (K's italics.) K may be right; it may have indeed happened like that, before she rushed into the nearby pub screaming ""Murder! Murder!"" He can be waspish: Anthony Rota was 'a poor judge of character'; Lar- kin is a 'paragon of seedy exactitude' whose 'oeuvre exudes impotence'; Brodsky was a pompous windbag'. On the other hand, he is hard on him- self as well, continually. He is one of those people who likes to say every- thing, even where prudence suggests otherwise. The result is an absolute page-turner. His style is SO immediate that whether one likes the people in the anecdote or not, one just has to know what happens. His footnotes are a delight - for instance, that books in green covers are the hardest to sell. His short final chapter concerns a trip to his barber (who is supplied with signed copies of new titles to store away as an investment). K fears his shop will go because of Covid and rising costs. In this way he ends on the same note as he began, on the remorseless decline in the opportunities for intelligent com- mercial discourse. It is sad to end a spirited book in such a negative way.

Living with the lasting effects of Covid-19 can be scary, especially when your symptoms don't go away or are changing. You might need to change the way you used to do things, and the amount of things you can do because of Long Covid. This can be a difficult adjustment, and getting used to managing your symptoms can be quite lonely, isolating, and frustrating which can affect your mood. Many people who are living with Long Covid have a 'grieving period' to process these changes, and to work through any negative emotions they may have. These negative moods and emotions are a part of the journey for some people, and like the other symptoms of Long Covid, may last a long time for some, and be short lived for others. If you experience a low mood or negative emotions that feel out of control, or will not go away, get in touch with your GP or Healthcare professional. There are many ways in which Covid-19 may have changed your mood. Here are some of the ways: Stress and a feeling of worry Low Mood - Around your recovery - Not meeting your friends and family - Your future - Feeling alone - Another infection - Not wanting to do things you used to like - Work, money Anger and Frustration Trauma - Wanting to recover faster - Nightmares and flashbacks from the - Why me? time youhave been unwell How can I help my emotions? There are a lot of things you can do to try and help the way you feel. Caring for yourself: Sometimes you can feel angry or wish you never had Covid-19 in the first place. You may think 'I am not good enough', 'I am worthless', 'I am such a hassle' and these feelings might make you want to hide away from others. Living with Long Covid is very difficult and sometimes it takes longer to recover. This does not mean that you are not good enough. You are doing the best you can to adapt! Try not to be harsh on yourself. Remember all the things you have accomplished since you got Long Covid and allow your body to take the time it needs to recover. Get the help you need: It is important to stay in touch with other people and speak to family and friends. Often, when we feel unwell, we tend to shut down, and avoid talking to others or doing the things we like. This can make us feel very alone and stuck feeling hopeless.

Dry mouth, bad breath, and/or gum disease. An annoying cough. Frequent chest infections. Difficulty in swallowing, eating, and drinking. Snoring and/or poor sleep. There are times when you may need to breathe through your mouth, such as: When your nose is blocked. When you are exercising. When you are feeling stressed or anxious. When the shape and size of your jaw, teeth or nose stop you from breathing through your nose. The nose: Acts as a filter, trapping small particles such as pollen and dust. Warms and humidifies the air, preventing dryness in the airways and lungs. Controls the speed of your breathing and in turn makes diaphragmatic breathing easier. Helps with speech and voice control. Helps with eating and drinking. Breathing with your Nose: If you find closing your mouth and breathing through your nose difficult - do not worry. You may only manage 2-3 breaths through your nose at a time. The more you practice nose breathing, the easier it will become. If you feel that you are breathing more through one nostril than the other - don't worry, this is normal. Our nose has a smart way of cleaning itself. While one nostril is going through the cleaning process, the other nostril does all the work. They swap every 90 minutes or so. Aim to practice breathing through your nose little and often. You may want to: Change the position you are in when practicing nose breathing (lying down, sitting on a chair, standing). Set yourself targets to increase the number of breaths you can manage. Set yourself targets to increase the length of time you can manage to breathe through your nose. If your nose is blocked, and has been blocked for some time, speak to your GP. Things that may help include: Humming a song for 1-2 minutes a day Nose sprays Sinus clearing medication Nasal Rinsing.

Just six of the fifty lots offered were unsold, although most of the books were hammered below estimate. Judging from the impressive provenances recorded in the online catalogue, Golden seems to have acquired most of his collec- tion during the frothy period when the trade and London houses were goading Sh. Saud into pushing natural history into the stratosphere. Five works reached six figures (all prices are given, according to The Book Collector's policy, without buyer's premium) : a fine set, with the usually lacking text, of Audubon's Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America at $230,000; the Doheny copy of Thornton's Temple of Flora at $120,000; Harmonia Macrocosmica by Cellarius at $110,000; a very nice second edition of Catesby's Natural History of Carolina &c. at just $100,000, the same price it achieved when last in the rooms in the Pflaumer sale, 1997, and well below the pre-sale estimate of $180,000-$250,000; and, inexplicably, $110,000 for an unpleasant copy of the Wied-Neuwied/ Bodmer Reise in das innere Nord-America, commendably described by Sotheby's as 'a later compiled set'. The next sale on Sotheby's schedule closed on 9 December. Marketed as the 'Age of Wonder' this online auction presented a group of diverse properties, evidently from a number of different consignors, under a the- matic umbrella seemingly intended to mimic the aura of a single-owner sale. While only half of the forty-four lots offered were sold, one of those was a heavily promoted holograph leaf by Charles Darwin summarising his theory of natural selection that made $700,000, about half the total of the sale and an auction record for the naturalist. It is worth noting that two days before the closing of Age of Wonder, Christie's New York closed an online sale of Fine Books and Manuscripts. The Christie's sale offered 200 more lots than Age of Wonder and sold 166 more lots than the Sotheby's auction, but achieved a total hammer price of only about $100,000 more-call it an extra $600 for every additional lot sold. Which was the more successful sale? Or are they like unhappy families: each successful (or unsuccessful) in its own way? A week later came Sotheby's online auction of Fine Books and Manuscripts, I9I lots with a sell-through rate of 70%, which contributed some $2,342,000 to its three-sale total of more than $5,536,000.

This is often called 'pacing'. Pacing can difficult. Learning to recognise how much energy to have, where your limits are, and if you can push these limits, can be confusing. Gentle activity is a good place to start, and you can increase your activity in line with how your body feels and set realistic goals. These goals can be large or small and should be manageable for you. An example of this is walking to visit your neighbour, sitting in the garden, or following an at-home yoga tutorial online. Whilst some of these examples will be achievable for some people living with Long Covid, they will not be for others. Make sure to tailor your activity to your own capabilities. Before you exercise, you must make sure that you are safe to exercise. If you are not sure, speak to your GP or another healthcare professional. Make sure that you are resting before you reach your limit, and make time to rest every day, not only on your 'bad days'. What is exercise tolerance? Exercise tolerance is how much you can exercise before you have to stop. This will help you manage your daily activities. The things that will make you stop are: feeling breathless, fatigue (extreme tiredness) and/or pain. We want you to stop before you are feeling breathless or fatigued. Poor exercise tolerance will happen if you have not been moving about for a long time or if you have been unwell. This means that you are not able to do as much as you used to be able to. Problems with your heart, lungs, nerves, bones or muscles can stop you from being able to exercise. This can make you feel breathless when you are walking, or going up and down stairs. You may also be weaker than you were before and feel more tired during or after activity. Safe rehabilitation can make you fitter and stronger. A good way to start exercising is a walking (or stepping) program. The starting level will vary between people. Things that can make you less fit are: Older age Other illnesses Obesity Bad diet Long Covid symptoms Smoking Long Covid Workbook 21"

There is one newspaper clipping inserted in vol- ume 20, a 1961 TLS review of the three Walpole volumes published in the previous year, but no other little surprises. I began reading my new purchase soon after it landed, usually al- ternating between Walpole and something unrelated. The volumes are not strictly chronological, the Yale editors having determined that it made more sense to organise them by correspondent (or groups of correspondents) : antiquaries, Eton friends, Walpole's architectural committee, society ladies and the Walpole family, for example. Walpole compartmentalised the content of his letters according to the person he was writing to, SO this arrangement gives a better picture of the range of his interests and the nature of his relations with individual recipients. Early on, Walpole realised he was in a unique position to document the public and private history of his times, and he routinely asked to get his letters back from their recipients, SO he could preserve, edit, annotate and sometimes sup- press them. I enjoyed the snarky comments about the Society of Antiquaries in the letters to and from the Revd. William Cole. The six volumes of the mostly one-sided correspondence with the marquise du Deffand were good for my French, but made for slower progress. (Walpole had almost of his letters to madame du Deffand de- stroyed after his death, for reasons that are unclear: he may have thought that a friendship with a blind lady twenty years his senior might expose him to ridicule, been embarrassed by his French (which was actually quite good, judging by what does survive) or worried he had been unkind - even cruel - to his friend.)

You'd have to have been quick to catch this exhibition at Suffolk Archives at The Hold, Ipswich, IP4 ILR, which lasted only until the beginning of January this year. W. S. COWELL started as a general printing house but reinvented itself as a progressive art printer in the 1930s. It specialised in co- lour-plate lithography and pioneered an acetate-sheet-based process called Plasticowell. This enabled Cowells to play a significant role in the history of printing in Ipswich and of children's books in Britain and beyond. The firm was instrumental in launching Puffin Picture Books at the outbreak of World War II, and worked with illustrators and artists such as Kathleen Hale (Orlando the Marmalade Cat), Edward Ardizzone, Hilary Stebbing, Pablo Picasso, Eric Ravilious and David Gentleman. The exhibition fo- cused on the colour children's book and contained, we're told, some really beautiful exhibits. We gladly report a couple of significant appointments.

A former RN submariner, he remained reassuringly unruffled at even the most lively committee meetings and we learn he had recently been researching a forthcoming Lambeth Friends trip to Strasbourg, Sélestat and Colmar, in characteristic and meticulous detail - library by library, restaurant by restaurant. Such cheerful attention to detail was John's style, to the great benefit of SO many 142"

In 2012, Peter Kidd identified a further important frag- ment. Los Angeles Public Library holds one quire of eight leaves, with sewing thread still intact, one partial quire of six leaves, and twelve individual leaves, some of them consecutive, others isolated, from a 13th-century miscellany associated with the Priory. The fragments survive with a portion of their original binding, and the front and rear pastedowns. 3 It is difficult to say anything with certainty about the creation, housing and use of monastic books at Nostell, as SO little contextual evidence survives, either locally or nationally. Only ten book lists from Augustinian foundations in England are known, and with the exception of Llanthony Secunda Priory in Gloucester, where some 140 books are recorded, only ten Augustinian houses have more than ten volumes surviving from their libraries.4 The Priory of Merton, for example, was one of the largest in England and its Registrum lists more than 230 titles, yet today only twenty-nine volumes survive, while Leicester Abbey owned more than 1,000 volumes, of which fewer than twenty are known. 5 The Augustinian rule was not prescriptive in its approach to the conduct of religious life, leading to variation in approaches to the chapter of the rule concerned with reading and writing.

output_mixed_4_redacted.pdf_ocr_output.csv,26,"How can I help my dysautonomia or POTS symptoms? Having a good sleeping habit (see 'managing sleeping difficulties' section, page 59) Pace yourself throughout the day. Try not to fit too much in - there will always be another day. Take your time and avoid rushing. If you have something more difficult to do: plan your activity, rest well before and leave time after to recover. Over time you will figure out when you can push yourself, and when you need to rest. Know that it is OK to rest when you feel that your body needs it. Avoid stress if possible. The autonomic nervous system is the body's fight/flight system and is triggered during periods of stress. Here are the standard self-treatment tips for POTS: Increase your salt and fluid intake once your doctor has approved this (aim for 3L of fluids and 8 grams of salt per day) Try an abdominal binder or full length medical compression stockings - this will help reduce blood pooling in your lower abdominal area and legs, which can reduce POTS symptoms Eat smaller meals throughout the day Avoid excessive carbohydrates/refined sugars Avoid hot showers, consider using a shower chair or taking your showers before bed so you have time tolay down after the shower. If you have a diagnosis of POTS or you want to find out more, please visit these websites for more information and advice: https://www.potsuk.org/ http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=95 Long Covid Workbook 57"

In February 1780 he asked to borrow the last edition of Hughes's Letters; and hoped Nichols would get 'Dennis upon Blackmore, and upon Cato, and anything of the same writer against Pope'. 36 In May he asked for the Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany Poems edited by Elijah Fenton and Sir Richard Blackmore's Essays upon Several Subjects37 and later the same year, impressed by Nichols's ability to track down rare books, Johnson asked him to find an edition of Prior's works published in 1740. 38 Other borrowers included Joseph Banks, who borrowed The Craftsman in 179539 and Joseph Warton, who bor- rowed William Bowyer's copy of the works of Alexander Pope in ten volumes in 1797. 40 But some books were not for loan: in 1805, when Samuel Pipe Wolferstan, a key helper in Nichols's History of Leicestershire, asked to borrow Thomas Hearne's 1774 edition of the Black Book of the Exchequer, he was told that it was interleaved with notes and too valuable to lend, but that he was welcome to consult it when next in London.41 Nichols was wise to be wary because not everything was safely re- turned. In 1797 John Baker Holroyd, Ist Earl of Sheffield, returned William Lambarde's Perambulation of Kent and Thomas Philpot's Villari Cantianum which Nichols had lent to Edward Gibbon in 1793 but which were found at Sheffield Park after Gibbon's death in 1794.
